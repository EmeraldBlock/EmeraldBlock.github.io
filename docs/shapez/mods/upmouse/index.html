<p>Tried to drag the map but accidentally clicked on something? Fear no more!</p>
<p>This mod stops that. Instead of triggering when you press your mouse, things trigger when you release your mouse without moving.</p>
<p>This affects editing signals, toggling buttons, and interacting with markers.</p>
