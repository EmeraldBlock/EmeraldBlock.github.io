<p>F3 screenshots are buggy and broken! This mod fixes them (and makes them better).</p>
<p>No more disappearing buildings. No more glitched items. And no more off-centered pixel distribution!</p>
<p>Take screenshots of select regions of your base the same way you select blueprints. Say goodbye to image stitching!</p>
<p>Plus, now you can make map view screenshots! Or take one with a transparent background! You can even choose image quality! All with a fancy new screenshot dialog.</p>
<p>This mod makes the screenshot code exactly match your ingame view. So change your game settings, and your screenshots will change to match!</p>
